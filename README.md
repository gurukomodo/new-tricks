# new-tricks
Hi There!!
🧓 I am as old as dirt.
🧑‍🏫 I am a teacher.
🍇 I am working on something to make teaching easier.
🏫 I am currently learning python any way I can. Including https://ai.google.dev/ and https://wiki.python.org/ - not very sexy I'm afraid.
Ask me about education. Don't ask me about coding...yet!
I believe in learning by doing, so I'm giving it a try. Any help is greatly appreciated.
